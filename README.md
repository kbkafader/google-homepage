Mini Project - Web Dev 101

This Project is going to give me a baseline understanding of actually 
working in HTML and CSS in a real world scenario. I am going to be 
creating a copy of the Google home page from scratch.

Life got in the way so this took longer than expected, and it's by no means 
perfect... but it's close enough and I'm ready to move on.
